# Overview

This app is a basic notes app intended for use in taking note of the blessing you may have seen in a day. This app provides individual entries that can easily be distinguished from others and can easily be navigated. UI is clean and user-friendly. 

I created this app because I wanted to learn how to create basic apps on both the Apple and Android platforms. I also wanted to experiment with the relatively new .NET Maui development platform created by Microsoft.
